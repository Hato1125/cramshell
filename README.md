## What is clamshell mode?
Clamshell mode allows you to work with your laptop lid closed, using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

## How to enable clamshell mode
**Required**
- At least one external monitor is connected
- The laptop lid is closed

**Optional**
- ~~The laptop is connected to AC power~~ TODO

## Comparison
macOS and systemd-based implementations require AC power as an absolute condition for clamshell mode, but clamshell does not.
It also does not depend on any init system, so it works in any environment.
