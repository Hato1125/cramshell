  <h1>CLAMSHELL</h1>
  <p>
    A lightweight daemon for implementing clamshell functionality on Linux without dependencies on systemd or other init systems.
  </p>
</div>

## WHAT IS CLAMSHELL MODE?
Clamshell mode allows your laptop to continue running with the lid closed, typically while connected to an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse

## WHY CLAMSHELL?
Traditional clamshell implementations often have limitations:
- Dependency on specific init systems (usually systemd)
- Requirement for AC power connection
- Complex setup procedures

clamshell solves these issues by providing a standalone daemon that works regardless of your init system and allows battery-powered operation.
